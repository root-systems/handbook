<h1 style="text-align: center">Enspiral Root Systems</h1>

We're a small high-trust livelihood pod doing tech consulting and software development within the [Enspiral](http://enspiral.com) network in Wellington.
Our purpose is to imagine and cultivate an [ecosystem](ecosystem/readme.md) of local, replicable, life-support systems for interdependent abundance.

## Our Handbook

Welcome to our handbook! This is the living documentation of our organisation - it promotes transparency between us internally as well as to the outside world. It also acts as a historical record of our group as we change and grow over time, with previous versions saved in the [public Git repo on Github.](https://github.com/enspiral-root-systems/meta)
