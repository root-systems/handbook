# Working with Root Systems as a contractor

## Pay

* Contractor receives 65% of charge out rate to client
* Root Systems receives 35% of charge out rate

The 35% Root Systems receives is to cover the risk involved with taking on a contract. Shit can happen and all legal responsibility is held by Root Systems.

It also covers the cost of finding contracts. We can spend a lot of unpaid time working with clients to find work. We also work with Golden Pandas and [pay them a retainer + commission every month](./golden-pandas.md).

## Invoicing

You are expected to send an invoice to Root Systems Limited at the first working day of every month.

Please send your invoices to rsaccounts@enspiral.com and cc in root-systems-coordinators@enspiral.com

Invoices will be paid by the 20th of every month.

## Time Tracking

We recommend using [Toggl](https://toggl.com). Please ask a Root Systems member to be invited to our Toggl team.

## Expenses

If you have any expenses that need claimed, include this in your monthly invoice along with the related receipts.
