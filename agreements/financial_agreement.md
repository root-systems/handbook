> This is version two of our financial agreement. We learned a **lot** from the first and overall deem it a success.

> Things that worked:
>
> - We never had to negotiate. We all knew the same calculation determined how much we each got paid.
> - When Greg joined, all he had to do was read our agreement and say he agreed... that easy!
> - Our pay went up and down based on how well our business was going.
>
> Things that didn't go so well:
>
> - We built the system to reward software development, but other activity types were not financially valued.
> - The base salary assumed we were all working full-time. In reality, we get sick and want to take leave.
> - As we paid people based on what they did rather than what they intended to do, we had to make relatively large assumptions about our outgoings when looking at cash flow forecasts.
>
> In our next iteration of the model, we want to experiment with the idea of paying members based on what they **say** they will do, rather than what they actually do. This may sound strange - but it's precisely what a salary is! We allow members to define a granular collection of activity types to determine their pay. We hypothesise that this gives us the benefits of having people on salary  (predictable outgoings and intent) while maintaining the flexibility of our current model (pay increases with company success).

> At least that's the idea ;)
