# Working With Us

Our approach to building great software is centered around design thinking and agile rhythms.

Here's an example of our _ideal_ external consulting contract:

- You, the client, have an existing source of revenue and want to build a new or replace an old software product or service.
- We start with a series of collaborative discovery workshops to focus and clarify the problem we're solving with you.
- We connect with relevant stakeholders to refine the scope into clear and actionable [job stories](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27#.layvu3kpi), preferably with accompanying [executable specifications](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/executableSpecifications.htm).
- We begin our iterative development process, charging hourly rates as fuel to push the vehicle forward.
- We continue to check back in with stakeholders at each relevant cycle, to ensure our work matches the needs of your business.

## Dev Philosophy

We practice continuous improvement in our work. Practically, we invest in the toolbelt we carry with us:

### Core

- [Dogstack](https://dogstack.js.org/), a popular-choice framework for production web apps with plugins:
  - [Dogstack Agents](https://github.com/dogstack/dogstack-agents) provides core user functionality

### Experimental

- [`cat-stack`](https://github.com/enspiral-root-systems/cat-stack)
- [`inu`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/inu)
- [`vas`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/vas)
