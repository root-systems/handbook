# Root Systems Theory of Change

[Our Long Term Vision](./vision.md) is broad and we do not have a concrete idea of what this Utopia might be. Rather we have Identified two (Theories of Change)[] that we beleive and pursue as steps towards this.

## An Ecosystem of Livelihood Pods

(Pods)[./glossary.md] are great by themselves, but are by themselves rather fragile. This is a by product of forming a group around a key activity or skill (a group of developers, designers, engineers, chefs, etc... typically services). As such there is a need to interface with other pods that have an alternative focus/service. Forming service agreements between the pods allows for each pod to derisk its external dependancy. This can be further established by having revenue share agreements - ideally bi-directional. That way each pod thrives or suffers together. This dependancy and risk sharing brings the pods closer together.

If we imaging this at scale there could be dozens of interelated pods that act autonomously, conduct some activities together, provide services to each other, provide services together to non pods and establish a Communal Basic Pod Income between them.

Developing an ecosystem of pods will allow for far greater innovation while maintaining security. Pods will have to negociate how each spend there time. eg can a pod just go on hiatus and still recieve a CBPI? We will work it out when we get there ;)

To deal with the problems of coordination and communication we will need a clear Protocol that each pod needs to meet to be in the Ecosystem of Pods. This may involeve pod structure, comunications channels, cadences, reporting and required tools.

At the moment Root Systems, Golden Pandas, Optize and Protoza are all pods working to establish the Alpha Protocol of an Ecosystem of Pods.

## Software for Our Supply Network

The supply network is the combination of our commodity and services markets. It is not designed or governed by many organisations and states, it has evolved with us over time - most likely really taking off with the agrian and industrial age.

A supply chain is a slice through the supply network, it is a conceived series of processes that make up the steps of the delivery of a service and/or product to an end human. Supply chains are always anchored by a collection of humans making up a market providing demand, it is the informal natural coordination of supply and demand. 

This could be the production of materials, processing/combining of materials, breaking up of goods into smaller units, delivery of goods, etc... You can imagine that every product or service has a supply chain story of how it came to the human consuming/recieving it.  

Except you generally won't know the story. The various organisations and traders in the chain act with a protectionist mindset, not sharing/passing on information about the chain in an attempt to maintain a "market edge". Though this in theory works, our examination of this is that in the long run it is harmful to humanity as a whole.

Our intervention is to develop a protocol to standardise the data shape to share information between supply chain actors. This protocol will allow for a new type of coordination, one more intentional. The market will be able to communicate their requirements to the supply network and find values aligned suppliers to meet the demand. The supply network will also be able to communicate with various markets finding out more specifically what the demand is, this way coordinating availibility with the demand.

This will lead to a transparent supply network. Where anyone may start supplying and be informed of what the market demands. 

We will end up with a supply network that is more human
