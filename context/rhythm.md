## Check-in

Every week we meet over lunch to check-in about our current happenings.

This is a safe space for us to share what's up with each other. What you say here, stays here.

## Away day

Every month, or as desired, we meet somewhere out of our normal space, to jam on group activities.

This is a productive space to coordinate and swarm on anything that needs to be done.

## Retreat

Every quarter we meet somewhere out-of-town for 2-3 days to catch up with the bigger picture.

This is a chill environment for us to relax and spend time with each other. Maybe we gather some retrospective feelings and set some forward-thinking strategy.

## [Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting)

Every year we spend 4-7 days somewhere out-of-town to set our annual big picture strategy.

This is basically a long retreat with a specific focus on large-scale business planning and coordination.
